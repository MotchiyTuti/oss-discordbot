# Minecraft Server Bot
This project is a management tool designed to simplify the start and stop operations of a Minecraft server.  
It includes features that the author personally finds useful.  
Built with Python 3 on Ubuntu LTS, the tool is lightweight and optimized for practical, hands-on deployment.

## Features
- Start and stop the Minecraft server via command
- Built with Discord bot integration in mind (easily expandable)
- Optimized for local environments and manual server operation

To activate the environment and run the program, use the following commands:
