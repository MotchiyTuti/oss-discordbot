# Minecraft Server Bot

This project is a management tool designed to simplify the start and stop operations of a Minecraft server, packed with features the author personally finds useful. Built with Python 3 on Ubuntu LTS, it aims for lightweight and practical deployment.

## Features

- Control Minecraft server start/stop via command
- Designed with Discord Bot integration in mind (expandable as needed)
- Optimized for local environments and hands-on server operation

## Setup

The `.venv/` virtual environment has already been created and all required packages are installed. To activate the environment and run the program, use the following commands:

## Usage
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
